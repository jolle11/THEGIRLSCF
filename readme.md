# The Crossfit Girls poster comes to life!
This is actually my first project as I begin my path to becoming a Full Stack developer. Next week I'll start my 3-Year apprenticeship in Web and Mobile development but I've been doing courses in Udemy since March of this year.
## The project

I'm a Crossfit addict and this idea's been in my head for a long time now and finally I decided to make it come to life.
At first it was a simple idea but with time and learning I want it to be a big project (not only the poster written in code).
For example, I would like to add maybe other girl WOD that are not in the original poster, adding tips and tricks for each WOD, creating a global leaderboard and many more that will come to my mind. So it's not going to be that simple :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
